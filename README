#Vue-Autorequest

`vue-autorequest` is a plugin that makes Vue-component 
self-loading and cut down duplicates of `axios.get`. 
It depends on axios to make HTTP request.

As a programmer, I have been duplicating this 
snippet of axios through out each component. 

```
function(){
  axios.get('')
  .then(function (response) {
    console.log(response)
  })
}
```

`vue-autorequest` does away with this snippet by setting the 
URL and receiving it at a destinated watch function. 

1. Set the url at `mounted.url`
2. Receive response its corresponding 
watch method onMounted()

```
new Vue({
  data: function(){
    return {
      mounted: { 
        url: ""
      }
    }
  },
  watch: {
    onMounted(res){
      console.log(res)
    }
  }
})
```

There are other 8 variables with its respective watch method: 

- beforeMount   | onBeforeMount
- beforeCreate  | onBeforeCreate
- created       | onCreated
- mounted       | onMounted
- updated       | onUpdated
- destroyed     | onDestroyed
- beforeDestroy | onBeforeDestroy
- beforeUpdate  | onBeforeUpdate
