#Vue-Autorequest

`vue-autorequest` is a plugin that makes Vue-component 
self-loading and cut down duplicates of `axios.get`. 
It depends on axios to make HTTP request.

As a programmer, I have been duplicating this 
snippet of axios through out each component. 

```
new Vue({

mounted: function(){
  axios.get('https://yesno.wtf/api')
  .then(function (res) {
    console.log(res)
  })
  .catch(function(err)) {
    console.log(err)
  }
}

})
```

`vue-autorequest` does away with this snippet by setting the 
URL and receiving it at a destinated watch function. 

1. Set the url at `mounted.url`

```
new Vue({
  data: function(){
    return {
      mounted: { url: 'https://yesno.wtf/api'}
    }
  }
})
```

2. Receive response its corresponding 
watch method onMounted()

```
new Vue({
  watch: {
    onMounted(res, err){
      console.log(res)
      console.log(err)
    }
  }
})
```


There are other 8 variables with its respective watch method: 

- Lifecycle stage | Watch method
- beforeMount     | onBeforeMount
- beforeCreate    | onBeforeCreate
- created         | onCreated
- mounted         | onMounted
- updated         | onUpdated
- destroyed       | onDestroyed
- beforeDestroy   | onBeforeDestroy
- beforeUpdate    | onBeforeUpdate
